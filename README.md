# Advent of Code 2024

This repository includes my code for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

As i've begun my journey in learning how to program and enrolling into a school for it, i've decided
to put what im learning into practice with this year's Advent of Code, fully doing it in C#.

*If you want to solve the puzzles yourself first, do so, **then** look for the solution to compare.*
Do **not** cheat yourself out of a great time and learning experience by just copying code!

**Please keep in mind most of this is hacked together.
I don't claim it's perfect code or even in all cases 100% valid/defined/proper code or whatever.
It's for fun and it got the job done in a short amount of time.** ðŸ˜€

This is mostly for those that are curious.
If you want to look at the code, experiment with it, change it, etc. be my guest.
